# Fabric_defect_detection

This project was done as part of my B.Tech 6th semester mini project.

The main objective of this project was to do image processing using OpenCV python and integrated the code with an android app developed in Flutter.

Python Libraries used:
    • Numpy
    • Flask
    • OpenCV (opencv-python)
